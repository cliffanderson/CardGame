1. DONE
Instead of using numbers to refer to clients, use Strings that identify their username.

2. DONE
Make it so that when a new client joins. It checks to see if the previous spots in the list are open or not.
So essentially, you have to use a implementation of a ADT.

3. DONE
See if there is a more proper way to use exceptions.
-There is, you can pass exceptions. The question is, should I do that?

You can pass the exceptions down by throwing exceptions, but as far as I know, its better to just check immediately for exceptions.
However, if you're logging the exceptions into a file, you might be able to just pass down exceptions through the methods into a method that handles
all exceptions possible and logs them.
At least, I'm assuming you can do that.

Bugs:
1. FIXED
In handleClients()
-the number of connections listening to needs to reduced when a connection is closed.

2. FIXED
In HandleClientThread class
-the clientNumber needs to be reduced by 1 for all elements above clientNumber for the client connection that was just closed.
