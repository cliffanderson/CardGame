1.
Instead of using numbers to refer to clients, use Strings that identify their username.

2. DONE
Make it so that when a new client joins. It checks to see if the previous spots in the list are open or not.
So essentially, you have to use a implementation of a ADT.

Bugs:
1. FIXED
In handleClients()
-the number of connections listening to needs to reduced when a connection is closed.

2. FIXED
In HandleClientThread class
-the clientNumber needs to be reduced by 1 for all elements above clientNumber for the client connection that was just closed.
